**Universal Instrumentation Code**

The Universal Instrumentation Code or [UIC] was created by Peter Grimshaw in 2014 to create a standard for the identification of instrumental parts that is not bound to any language or convention and can provide new ways to search and display the instrumental requirements of printed music.

The UIC is licensed under a [Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/) so that it can be freely used  by any sort of system that catalogues instrumental parts creating data sets that can be easily shared with different systems.

A technical description of the UIC by Mark Carroll, James Koehne and Peter Grimshaw was published in the [Music Reference Services Quarterly Volume 17, 2014 â€“ Issue 1](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10588167.2014.873226?mobileUi=0&journalCode=wmus20)
